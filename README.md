## Summary of Site/ How to Use

We all have great ideas, but often don't have an easy, user-friendly way to capture them. This site will allow users to input their own idea title and more idea information within the body input. Only when both fields are populated with the "Save" button activate and allow the user to store their brilliant ideas. 
Once saved, the ideas will remain in the Idea Display until the user no longer wishes to keep them and selects the "x" icon in the upper right hand corner of the idea card to delete that idea. 
If there is a particularly memorable idea, the user can select the star icon in the upper left hand corner of the idea card to indicate with an orange star this idea is a favorite. 
Selecting the "Show Starred Ideas" button will filter the ideas and only display favorites. 
Select the button again (now displaying "Show All Ideas") to view all idea cards again. 
There is also a search bar that searches for the characters entered to find any applicable idea cards with matching title/body information.
